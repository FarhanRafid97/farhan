# Create Your own modal Component

## 1. Create custom Hook

This code defines a custom React hook called **`useOutsideClick`** that can be used to detect clicks outside a specified DOM element and trigger an action when such clicks occur. Let's break down this code step by step:

1. Import Statements:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
```

- This code imports the necessary modules from the React library, specifically **`React`** and **`useEffect`**. **`useEffect`** is a hook in React used for managing side effects in functional components.

1. Interface Declaration:

```jsx
interface ValidRefTarget {
  contains(target: EventTarget | null): any;
}
```

- An interface named **`ValidRefTarget`** is defined. This interface represents the expected shape of a reference object that can be used with this hook. It specifies a single method, **`contains`**, which should take an **`EventTarget`** or **`null`** as an argument and return any type (**`any`**).

1. **`useOutsideClick`** Hook:

```jsx
export function useOutsideClick(
  ref: React.RefObject<ValidRefTarget>,
  isOpen: boolean,
  setIsOpen: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>,
  isDisabled?: boolean,
) {
  // ...
}
```

- This is the main **`useOutsideClick`** hook function that you can use in your React components.
- It takes four parameters:
  - **`ref`**: A **`React.RefObject`** that is expected to refer to a DOM element with a **`contains`** method (as specified by the **`ValidRefTarget`** interface). This is the element to which the click outside detection will be applied.
  - **`isOpen`**: A boolean that indicates whether the component, which the outside click detection is associated with, is open.
  - **`setIsOpen`**: A state updater function that allows you to update the **`isOpen`** state based on click events.
  - **`isDisabled`** (optional): A boolean flag that, if set to **`true`**, will disable the outside click detection. This is useful when you want to temporarily disable the outside click behavior.

1. **`useEffect`** Hook:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isDisabled) {
    return;
  }
  function handleClickOutside(event: globalThis.MouseEvent) {
    if (ref.current && !ref.current.contains(event.target) && isOpen) {
      setIsOpen(false);
    }
  }

  document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside);
  };
}, [ref, isOpen, setIsOpen, isDisabled]);
```

- The **`useEffect`** hook is used to set up and clean up event listeners for detecting clicks outside the specified element.
- The effect is conditional on the **`isDisabled`** flag. If **`isDisabled`** is **`true`**, the effect does nothing and immediately returns.
- Inside the effect, a **`handleClickOutside`** function is defined. This function checks if a click occurred outside the element specified by **`ref`** and if the component is in an open state (**`isOpen`** is **`true`**). If both conditions are met, it calls **`setIsOpen(false)`** to close the component.
- Event listeners for the **`'mousedown'`** event are added to the **`document`** to track clicks outside the element.
- A cleanup function is returned from the effect, which removes the event listener when the component unmounts or when the dependencies (**`ref`**, **`isOpen`**, **`setIsOpen`**, **`isDisabled`**) change.

In summary, this custom **`useOutsideClick`** hook allows you to easily implement the behavior of closing a component (e.g., a modal) when a user clicks outside of it. The hook takes care of the necessary event listeners and provides an **`isDisabled`** option for temporarily disabling this behavior when needed.

## 2. Create Modal Component

creating a modal (a pop-up dialog box) and a modal that can be closed by clicking outside of it. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. import Statements:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

- This code imports the necessary modules from the React library. **`useState`** is a React hook that allows you to manage state within functional components.

1. Interface Declaration:

```jsx
interface ModalProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  isOpen: boolean;
  setIsOpen: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}
```

Here, an interface called **`ModalProps`** is defined. This interface describes the expected props for both the **`Modal`** and **`ModalWithOutsideClick`** components. It has three properties:

- **`children`**: This prop is of type **`React.ReactNode`** and represents the content that will be displayed inside the modal.
- **`isOpen`**: This prop is a boolean indicating whether the modal should be open or closed.
- **`setIsOpen`**: This prop is a function of type **`React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>`** that allows you to change the **`isOpen`** state.

1. **`Modal`** Component:

```jsx
export const Modal: React.FC<ModalProps> = ({ children, isOpen, setIsOpen }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="modal">
          <div className="modal-content">{children}</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

- This is a functional React component named **`Modal`**. It takes three props: **`children`**, **`isOpen`**, and **`setIsOpen`**.
- Inside the component, there is a button that, when clicked, sets the **`isOpen`** state to **`true`**, opening the modal if it's closed.
- If **`isOpen`** is **`true`**, the modal content (specified by **`children`**) is rendered within a **`<div>`** with the class name "modal."

1. **`ModalWithOutsideClick`** Component:

```jsx
export const ModalWithOutsideClick: React.FC<ModalProps> = ({ children, isOpen, setIsOpen }) => {
  const modalRef = React.useRef < HTMLDivElement > null;

  useOutsideClick(modalRef, isOpen, setIsOpen);

  return (
    <Modal isOpen={isOpen} setIsOpen={setIsOpen}>
      <div ref={modalRef}>{children}</div>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```

- This is another functional React component named **`ModalWithOutsideClick`**, which is designed to be a modal that can be closed by clicking outside of it.
- It takes the same three props: **`children`**, **`isOpen`**, and **`setIsOpen`**.
- It creates a ref (**`modalRef`**) that will be attached to the outermost **`<div>`** of the modal content.
- It uses a custom hook called **`useOutsideClick`** (not defined in the provided code) to handle clicks outside of the modal. Presumably, this hook would be defined elsewhere in your codebase and would be responsible for closing the modal when a click occurs outside of it.
- The content (specified by **`children`**) is rendered inside a **`Modal`** component, and the **`modalRef`** is attached to the outer **`<div>`** of the content.

Overall, these components allow you to create a modal dialog in your React application, with the option to have a modal that can be closed by clicking outside of it. However, the **`useOutsideClick`** hook is not defined in the provided code, so you would need to implement that separately to make the outside click functionality work.

In conclusion, this tutorial provided a comprehensive guide on creating your own modal component in React. We started by introducing a custom hook, **`useOutsideClick`**, which allows you to detect clicks outside a specified DOM element. We then explored the implementation of a **`Modal`** component that can be opened and closed with a button click. Additionally, we introduced the **`ModalWithOutsideClick`** component, which extends the functionality by allowing the modal to be closed by clicking outside of it. However, please note that the **`useOutsideClick`** hook was not provided in the code, so you would need to implement it separately to enable the outside click functionality in your modal.

By following this tutorial, you now have the knowledge and foundation to create customizable modals tailored to your specific requirements. Modals are a powerful tool for displaying important information or gathering user input in a clean and intuitive manner. So go ahead and start implementing your own modal component in your React projects!

Remember to experiment, customize, and enhance the modal component to suit your application's unique needs. Happy coding!
